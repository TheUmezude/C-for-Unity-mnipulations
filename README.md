# C-for-Unity-mnipulations
This is a repository for C# Unity game development syntaxes. Very essential information on easily forgettable C# syntaxes and concepts are featured here. This is not a functional program and should not be run with an IDE, directly. Rather, it should be opened with a text editor like 'Notepad++', 'Atom' or the likes. The repository would be updated from time to time. Concepts that may be missing can be pointed out for inclusion.  Note: This is not a learning guide for absolute beginners of C# programming and/or Unity. It is just more like a reference of important concepts for those who are a bit more advanced with the C# programming language.
